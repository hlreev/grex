# Welcome to GRex!

## About
This simple, GUI-based application will allow a user to input criteria that will then be used to determine the best probabilistic graphicast to use for a specific forecast scenario.

## Disclaimer
This is a starter project and is still under development. It is not yet meant to be used operationally for decision making or forecast dissemination.

## Information
This program uses a JSON pseudo-database along with user-selected initial conditions to determine the best probabilistic graphicast for any situation (including those where a probabilistic graphicast is not recommended.)
