# Welcome to GRex!

## About
This simple GUI-based program will allow a user to input criteria that will then be used to determine the best probabilistic graphicast to use for a specific forecast scenario.

## Disclaimer
This is a starter project and is still under development.

## Information
This program uses a JSON pseudo-database along with user-inputted initial conditions to determine the best probabilistic graphicast for any situation (including those where a probabilistic graphicast is not recommended to be used.)
